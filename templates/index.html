                <p>The data obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS) and the Behavioral Risk
                    Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2014 is visualized as follows </p>

                <p>From the above graph there is  inverse relationship between the household income and
                    smoking with exception of the state of Utah which doesn't seem to fit well with the trend. The other inverse relation 
                    is between age dependency and alcohol consumption (if we exclude DC, this relationship will 
                    become more apparent).The graph also shows  inverse relation between poverty and being physically active as well as alcohol consumption where as poverty has a direct relation with smoking.</p>

                    <p> In most of the cases Puerto Rico looks an outlier.It is situated clustered out from other states.
